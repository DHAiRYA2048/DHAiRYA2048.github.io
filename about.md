This is where you put the contents of your *About* page. Like all your pages, it's in [Markdown](https://guides.github.com/features/mastering-markdown/) format.

On a high level, I only love 3 things; business, history, technology. That's where majority of my time goes into. My aim in life? I want to create a wonderful novel product with some brilliant and interesting people, which is _really_ helpful to the world, by using multiple cool technologies efficiently and have a good business model around it.
