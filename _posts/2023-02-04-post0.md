# How I plan to develop my blog and writing skills

## Date: 4 Feb 2023
From today, I'll be the one who blogs with discipline. My aim for maintaining this blog site is primarily powered by 2 reasons;
1. Sharpen my writing skills so that I can convey my thoughts to people in a much powerful way
2. To get better understanding about myself because I believe writing has the capability to do so.
