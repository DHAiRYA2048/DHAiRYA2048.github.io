# How I plan to develop my blog and writing skills

`Date: 4 Feb 2023`  
From today, I'll be the one who blogs with discipline. My aim for maintaining this blog site is primarily powered by 2 reasons;
1. Sharpen my writing skills so that I can convey my thoughts to people in a much powerful way.
2. To get better understanding about myself because I believe writing has the capability to do so.

I'll write fortnightly which should contain either deeper knowledge about something interesting or something which changed my perspective. If I can't make time for a post, I'll simply write a small post about my experience(s) of the week or notes from the current book I'm reading. You might think that I prioritize quantity over quality but that's not the case at all. When starting a new habit, just 'showing up' makes a lot of difference in quality and bolsters confidence in self which is quite visible, but only in retrospect.

After publishing a new post, I'll analyze it and learn a new technique which would make my wriitng better. I'll make a habit to apply this technique in my next post and also mention it explicitly in the footnote. 

## Footnotes
I didn't apply any writing technique here, apparently.
